### Hypeparameter Analysis on Wide-Kernel CNNs

This repository is supplementary to our paper "Hyperparameter Analysis of Wide-Kernel CNN Architectures
in Industrial Fault Detection – An Exploratory Study" for reproducing our proposed models and their performance. Furthermore, this repository contains the results of all the models in the hyperparameter search on the three used datasets, e.g, CWRU, Gearbox and Paderborn. 

### Requirements

Usage of our code requires many packages to be installed on your machine. The most important packages are listed below:

* Numpy
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Pandas
* Sklearn
